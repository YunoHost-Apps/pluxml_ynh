pluxml_ynh
==========
A yunohost version of PluXml : http://www.pluxml.org

once installed, go to the web path of pluxml and follow the instructions.

TODO
=====

-dodge the installation step by giving settings to pluxml (installation will be automatic)

-set files permissions to 750 for the whole folder (cause after installation step, configuration folder is created with word readable permission, that folder contains login infos with hashed pass via sha1 oO)
